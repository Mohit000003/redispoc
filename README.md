## **REDIS**

The purpose of this POC is to evaluate Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) which is a  open-source in-memory database that stores data in key-value format. Itâ€™s widely used for caching, real-time analytics, message brokering, and more.


## **Redis Installation on Ubuntu**

This document provides step by step guide to install and configure Redis-server on Ubuntu.


### **Installation Steps**

### **Step 1: Update System Packages**

Before starting the installation, ensure your system packages are up-to-date.

``` bash
sudo apt update
```
### **Step 2: Install Redis and check the version**

To install Redis, use the apt package manager and check the version of redis

``` bash
sudo apt install redis-server -y

redis-server -v
```

### **Step 3: Start Redis Service**
Run the following command to start the Redis service: When you start the Redis service, it will begin running and be available for use. Enabling Redis ensures it will automatically start every time the system boots, providing persistent availability.

``` bash
sudo systemctl status redis

sudo systemctl enable redis
```

### **Step 4: Check Redis Service Status**
To confirm that Redis is running successfully, use the following command:

``` bash
sudo systemctl status redis
```


### **Step 5: Configure Redis**
To set up Uusername and password ( for better security) for Redis and change its bind address to your private ip so that you can use that internally not allowing access to everyone we can use following steps:-
  
  ### 1 **Open the Redis configuration file:-**

``` bash
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
```
### **Save and Close the file.**

 ### 2 **Set a Username and password and we can do it in 2 WAYS :-** 

 **1.** **Programmatically/Dynamically Using ACL SETUSER**:- Use the ACL SETUSER command to create or update a user with specific permissions dynamically while Redis is running.

``` bash
ACL SETUSER myuser on >mypassword ~* +@all
```
Here repalce myuser and mypassword with strong username and password
```
myuser: The username being created.
mypassword: The password associated with the user.
on: Enables the user.
~*: Grants access to all keys.
+@all:Grants access to all commands

```
 **2.**  **Statically via the redis.conf File**:- Edit the redis.conf file to define the user.

``` bash
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
user myuser on >mypassword ~* +@all
```
**Note:-** Here repalce myuser and mypassword with strong username and password

### **Step 6: Restart Redis:-**
To apply these changes, restart Redis service:

``` bash
sudo systemctl restart redis
```

###  **Step 7 : - Connect to Redis with username and Password after entering to the  cli:-** 

Now, you can authenticate to Redis using the username and  password.

Start the Redis CLI: Here if we directly enter some command after entering  into the cli it will give error as we need to authenicate it other wise it will show below thing

``` bash
redis-cli
Enter something 
(ERROR) NOAUTH Authentication Required
```

thats why use the below command to get access inside the redis-cli


``` bash
redis-cli
AUTH <myuser> <mypassword>
```
After that you can use below command You should see details about the configured users, including permissions and key patterns
``` bash
ACL LIST
```

or you can try in this way also instead of writing it manually everytime not recommed , Avoid using the -a option or storing passwords in plain text, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities.

``` bash
redis-cli --user <username> -a <password>
```


### **Step 8:- Verify the Connection:-** 
After authenticating, you can test the connection by running a simple command PING:

``` bash
PING
```
If you see PONG, it means authentication is successful.



### **Step 9:- SET and GET values in Redis (Additional) to check further if it is working fine for Storing and Retrieving Data in Redis :-**
SET is used to store data in Redis.

``` bash
SET mykey "<value>"
```
GET is used to retrieve the value stored under the specified key.
``` bash
GET mykey
```
